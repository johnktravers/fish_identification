All teeth are conical and strong canines are present on the premaxilla, anterior part of the maxilla and the dentary. Small conical teeth are present on the ectopterygoid and minute conical teeth have been detected on the mesopterygoid of some species. Other exclusive features of the group are: first infraorbital covering almost completely the maxilla whent the mouth is closed; a branch of the laterosensory canal  on the premaxilla; and rhinosphenoid bone in close contact with  parasphenoid. The anal fin is falcate, never bearing hooks in sexually mature males and the origin of the dorsal fin is much nearer to caudal base than the tip of the snout.

Three species occur further south in the São Francisco, Paraná, Paraguay and La Plata drainages. They are found in a variety of habitats, but primarily live in lakes, lagoons, areas near shore, and the smallest species are especially found in small streams (igarapés) of the Amazon basin (personal observation and see also Britski et al., 1986). The peculiar dentition makes acestrorhynchid species very specialized predators among characiforms, most species feeding primarily on fishes.

The eyed-side lower lip has a conspicuous, variously fringed fleshy rim which distinguish the species of this family from other sympatrical flatfishes. The lower lip is internally strengthened by a cartilaginous piece positioned laterally to dentary, the upper free half above the dentary dorsal margin; this cartilaginous piece, which is visible only by dissection or in cleared and stained preparations, is also present in other flatfish families, but clearly less developed than in achirids. The posterior nare forming a wide longitudinal slit above posterior end of upper lip, and hidden by lower lip when mouth is closed, is also a diagnostic external feature for achirids. A similar feature also appear in Soleidae, but it is never covered by lower lip; soleids do not occur in the Neotropics. The anterior nare is tubular as in some other flatfishes families. Margin of preopercle evidenced by a narrow naked area, particularly on its angle; this area is very narrow in adults and concealed by scales in juveniles of \u003ci\u003eSoleonasus\u003c/i\u003e. Teeth villiform, organized in a patch and present on jaws only in the blind side, except for \u003ci\u003eHypoclinemus mentalis\u003c/i\u003e, which possesses teeth on jaws of both eyed and blind sides. Dorsal fin extends forward onto cranium up to anterior end of upper jaw, which is often covered by a fringed dermal flap projected from anterior end of this fin. In \u003ci\u003eAchiropsis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eApionichthys\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003ePnictes\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eSoleonasus\u003c/i\u003e the anterior end of dorsal fin and its corresponding supracranial area extend beyond and conceal anterior margin of mouth. Eyed-side pelvic fin united to anal fin by membrane; both pelvic fins enclosed in a single dermal envelope in \u003ci\u003eGymnachirus\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eSoleonasus\u003c/i\u003e, also united to anal fin by membrane; pelvic fins extend forward in \u003ci\u003eAchiropsis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eApionichthys\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003ePnictes\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eSoleonasus\u003c/i\u003e, the first pelvic-fin ray inserted just below ventral end of mandibular symphysis. Dorsal and anal fins free from caudal fin in most species, or united to caudal fin by a narrow membrane in \u003ci\u003eAchiropsis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eApionichthys\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003ePnictes\u003c/i\u003e. Pectoral fins often minute, present in one or both sides, or absent. Lateral line frequently ornamented with dermal processes or ramified tubes, particularly on head. Scales ctenoid, those of head external margin larger than the others on body, and a little turned to its center; scales are absent in \u003ci\u003eGymnachirus\u003c/i\u003e, except for remains of lateral line tubes on head and body. Medium size achirid species are 15 centimeters long, the largest species occurring in freshwater. They are carnivores, eating fishes and benthic invertebrates. Fully developed gonads were examined in specimens 2.5 centimeters SL, from a species which grow up to 12 centimeters. \r\n\r\nCommon names of these fishes are American Sole (English), Lenguado (Spanish), Linguado (a general Portuguese word for Pleuronectiformes). In several Brazilian regions they are also known as Solha, Sôia, Sóia, Tapa or Aramaçá. Presently, nine genera and 28 species are recognized (Nelson, 1994). No recent revisional work is available. Chabanaud (1928) published a review of achirids, but it is not a comprehensive work. The achirid genera are presently being reviewed by the author, and synonymization of some genera and species will be proposed. Also, some species restricted to freshwater and referred to \u003ci\u003eApionchthys\u003c/i\u003e, and marine species referred to \u003ci\u003eTrinectes\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eAchirus\u003c/i\u003e will be described.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage that composes the family Achiridae was traditionally treated as part of the Soleidae, in subfamilial ranking. Jordan (1923) proposed familial ranking to that assemblage. This view was subsequently supported by Chabanaud in several papers (e.g. 1935, 1939), but not by Greenwood et al. (1966). Recently, Chapleau and Keast (1984) proposed the monophyly of the achirids based on five osteological cranial characters, but rejected the traditional view of a monophyletic Soleidae (Soleinae + Achirinae), previously supported by other authors. A cladistic study of intergeneric relationships, also in progress by the present author, detected eight new exclusive characters to support the monophyly proposed by Chapleau and Keast (1984) for the achirids. \r\n\r\nAchirids are mainly shore fishes restricted to both sides of Americas, including the subtropical, southern portion of Neartic region, and all the Neotropics, except for its extreme south. The genera \u003ci\u003eAchiropsis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eApionichthys\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003ePnictes\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eSoleonasus\u003c/i\u003e are restricted to freshwater in northern South American rivers, except for \u003ci\u003eApionichthys dumerili\u003c/i\u003e, which occurs in estuarine areas of the Orinoco, Corantjin, Oiapoque, Amazonas and Grajaú basins, also entering low lands freshwaters as do some other marine achirid species, and in marine areas under the influence of those rivers. Two species of \u003ci\u003eCatathyridium\u003c/i\u003e are restricted to the Paraguay-Paraná, and Uruguay systems, and one species (\u003ci\u003eC. garmani\u003c/i\u003e) occurs in estuarine and marine coastal areas of Southeastern Brazil, including Lagoa dos Patos, and coastal areas of Northern Uruguay.

Apteronotid species are readily recognized as the only gymnotiform fishes with a caudal fin and a dorsal organ (a longitudinal strip of fleshy tissue firmly attached to posterodorsal midline). Among gymnotiforms, apteronotid species also possess the following unique combination of characters: small eye (its diameter less than distance between nares); infraorbital and supraorbital laterosensory lines connected anterior to eye; infraorbital bones ossified as slender tubes; anterior nares located outside gape; no urogenital papilla; 1-2 rows of conical teeth in both jaws; anal-fin origin at, or anterior to, isthmus; no urogenital papilla.  Apteronotids also possess a high frequency tone-type electric organ discharge (more than 750 Hz at maturity). \r\n                                                                                                      \r\nThere are currently 72 names available in the literature for apteronotid genera and species. Of these, 13 generic and  52 species names are valid.  There are in addition 12 manuscript names for species currently in preparation, bringing the known diversity of Apteronotidae to 64 species. Many more apteronotid species are anticipated, as the rate of description is accelerating. \r\n \r\nApteronotids are relatively conservative in terms of overall external morphology. Like all gymnotiforms the shape is typically culteriform, with an elongate body and anal fin. Higher level apteronotid taxonomy emphasizes differences in snout length and shape, and shape and position of the mouth. Apteronotids exhibit substantial diversity in total adult body size, ranging from an undescribed Amazonian species of \u003ci\u003eAdontosternarchus\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eMegadontognathus kaitukaensis\u003c/i\u003e (each growing to about 160 mm) to \u003ci\u003eApteronotus\u003c/i\u003e (formerly \u003ci\u003eUbidia\u003c/i\u003e) \u003ci\u003emagdalenese\u003c/i\u003e (1.3 M) (Campos-da-Paz, 1999). \r\n                                                                                                      \r\nThe Apteronotidae is confined to the Humid Neotropics, ranging the Rio de la Plata of Argentina (35° S) to the Rio Tuira of Panama (8°N). Apteronotids are known from the continental waters of all South American countries except Chile (Albert, 2001), and are most diverse  - both taxonomically and ecologically - in the Amazon basin. \r\n\r\nThe ecology and natural history of most apteronotid species is poorly understood. \u003ci\u003eApteronotus\u003c/i\u003e species are the most widely distributed, extending the full range of the family. \u003ci\u003eApteronotus\u003c/i\u003e species inhabit both floodplain and tierra firme (non-floodplain) streams and rivers. Like many apteronotids, \u003ci\u003eApteronotus\u003c/i\u003e are aggressive predators of small aquatic insect larvae and fishes.  Apteronotids are most diverse in the Amazonian floodplain, where many species are specialized to inhabit deep portions of the river channel.  Some main channel apteronotids are aggressive piscivores (e.g., \u003ci\u003eSternarchella\u003c/i\u003e), whereas other are planktivores (\u003ci\u003eAdontosternarchus\u003c/i\u003e). \u003ci\u003eMagosternarchus\u003c/i\u003e spp. predate the tails of other electric fishes. Other species (e.g., \u003ci\u003eSternarchorhynchus\u003c/i\u003e,\r\n\u003ci\u003eSternarchorhamphus\u003c/i\u003e) have tubular snouts and forage on the beds of aquatic insect larvae on the rivers bottoms. At least one species (\u003ci\u003eSternarchogiton nattereri\u003c/i\u003e) eats freshwater sponges which grow on submerged trees, stumps, and other woody debris. \u003ci\u003eOrthosternarchus\u003c/i\u003e is perhaps the most specialized for life at the river bottom, in many ways resembling cave fishes;  they are almost entirely blind, with minute, assyemtically arranged eyes; and they have almost no pigments or scales, appearing bright pink in life due to the underlying blood hemoglobin.  \r\n\r\nAn important aspect of apteronotid diversity is sexual dimorphism in snout size and shape.  Reproductively mature males of \u003ci\u003eParapteronotus hasemani\u003c/i\u003e have highly elongate jaws, which are presumed to be involved in male-male competition. Mature males of \u003ci\u003eSternarchorhynchus roseni\u003c/i\u003e possess numeous teeth on their lower jaw. Mature male \u003ci\u003eSternarchogiton nattereri\u003c/i\u003e grow teeth externally over the snout, giving them an appearance to unusuall that for 40 years they have been regarded as representing an entirely different genus (\u003ci\u003eOedemognathus\u003c/i\u003e). \r\n\r\nApteronotid systematics and taxonomy is rapidly changing as new species and previously undocumented phenotypes are discovered. The total expected number of species cannot currently be estimated with confidence.  A large number of undescribed apteronotid species are known in museum collections and many more are likely to be captured from continued field studies, particularly in Western and Central Amazonia. \r\n  \r\nThere is little direct commercial exploitation of Apteronotid species. Many species are ecologically important in Amazonian floodplains, often constituting a significant fraction of the biomass (Crampton, 1996). Two species (\u003ci\u003eApteronotus albifrons\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eA. leptorhynchus\u003c/i\u003e) are common in the aquarium trade.

Carnivorous, feeding largely on small fishes which they catch sideways in their beaks. Needlefishes tend to leap and skitter at the surface and some people have been injured when accidentally struck by them, particularly at night when the fishes are attracted by lights. Eggs have entangling tendrils which act as holdfasts to each other and to objects in the water (Ref. 205).\r\nInterest to Fisheries: Caught by casting or trolling surface or near-surface lures and in floating gill nets.

The African tetras are recognized in the separate family Alestiidae, following Eschmeyer 1998 (Ref. 26282). \u003cb\u003eGlandulocaudinae\u003c/b\u003e:  Fishes of the subfamily Glandulocaudinae have the following characteristics: In sexually mature males glandulocaudines bear a basal caudal-fin organ that is apparently pheromone in nature.  This organ may consist of modified caudal-fin rays; modified caudal-fin scales, a derived hypural fan, and/or modified caudal-fin musculature. In species of some tribes and genera two to all of these derived features may be present.  In males almost always some kind of derived glandular cells are present in association with large derived caudal-fin scales and/or modified fin rays.  All species are inseminating in that the female is inseminated by the male and retains live sperm cells in her ovary, sometimes at least for many months.  No fertilization of the oocytes takes place in the ovaries and presumably fertilization takes place when the eggs and sperm cells are shed at the same time.  All species have elongate sperm cell bodies (nuclei) and, at least for the many species and genera for which current information is available, have sperm cells with an elongate cytoplasmic collar binding the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at least at some stage of spermiogenesis.  There is one other inseminating group of characids, the tribe Compsurini of the subfamily Cheirodontinae has inseminating species and also often complex caudal organs in the male.  These caudal organs are structured differently than those found in the Glandulocaudinae and the histology and fine structure of the sperm cells of the Compsurini are not structured the same way as in the glandulocaudines.  Furthermore there is evidence that the Compsurini forms a derived clade within the Cheirodontinae.  See Burns et al. (1995), Burns et al. (1997), Burns, et al. (1998), Burns et al. (2000), Malabarba (1998), Menezes \u0026 Weitzman (1990), Weitzman \u0026 Fink (1985), Weitzman et al. (1994), and Weitzman \u0026 Menezes (1998).      \r\n    \r\nThe Glandulocaudinae is a morphologically diverse characid group consisting of 19 genera divided among seven tribes, each derived in a different way.  The number of valid species currently recognized is 50.  Most glandulocaudine fishes are relatively small, between about 30 and 60 millimeters in standard length, but some are considerably smaller, between about 11 and 30 millimeters in standard length when mature.  See Weitzman \u0026 Fink (1985), Weitzman et al. (1994), and Weitzman \u0026 Menezes (1998).    \r\n    \r\nGlandulocaudine species are found almost throughout Central and South America, from Costa Rica in the north, southward to northern Argentina in the south.  They are found in every country, including Trinidad, except Chile.\r\n \r\nThe ecology and life history of glandulocaudines is complex, but so far little studied.  Many occur in small to modest sized streams tributary to larger rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco and Paraguay Rivers.  Nearly all glandulocaudines are tropical in distribution with a few being subtropical and are known from coastal streams of Central and South America tributary to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Caribbean Sea.  A few species are known from elevations as high as about 500 to 600 meters, but most occur at elevations considerably below that, down to sea level.  Some species are confined to acid black rainforest waters with an acidic pH, others are found in neutral to somewhat alkaline waters that are clear or seasonally turbid due to sediment load.  A few species are adapted to both kinds of waters.  No species are known from brackish waters of coastal lagoons or river mouths under the influence of tides.  The courtship behaviors of those species and genera that have been studied in detail using scientific procedures have been described as having complicated courtship procedures preceeding insemination.  Aquarists have published many articles about the behavior of glandulocaudines maintained in aquaria during the last 90 years.  These articles describe in varying detail the complex courtship activities of many glandulocaudine species and genera. This literature was last evaluated by Nelson (1964).  Personal observations and see also Azevedo et al. (2000), Nelson (1964a, b, \u0026 c), Weitzman \u0026 Fink (1985), Weitzman (1987), Weitzman et al. (1994).                              \r\n\r\nAlthough 50 species are currently recognized, there are many undescribed species represented by population samples in museums that await descriptions. Each of the seven tribes appears monophyletic although additional studies are needed to confirm this for a few of these tribes.  On the other hand the validity of the monophyly of the subfamily needs much further investigation. A few outgroup inseminating characids lack a caudal organ, but have some of the other glandulocaudine synapomorphies that were reported recently by Weitzman \u0026 Menezes (1998).  It may well be that at least some of the glandulocaudine tribes are independently derived from plesiomorphic extinct relatives of these outgroup characids such as the species of \u003ci\u003eBrittanichthys\u003c/i\u003e, some species of \u003ci\u003eKnodus\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eAttonitus\u003c/i\u003e.  See Burns et al. (2000).\r\n\r\nMembers of this subfamily form food for larger fishes that are important for both commercial and subsistence reasons in the rivers of Central and South America.  Several species are moderately important for the aquarium trade and are exported especially from Brazil and Venezuela. \r\n\r\nThe Iguanodectinae is a small characid subfamily composed of 11 valid species in 2 genera, Iguanodectes Cope and Piabucus Oken. The subfamily is characterized by elongated fishes, with contracted base multicuspidated teeth, gill-membranes united and free from the isthmus, posterior end of the maxilla anterior to the eye, dorsal-fin origin posterior to the middle of the body (at middle of  the body in Iguanodectes geisleri), and anal fin long (except for I. geisleri). Moreover, some characters of the internal morphology are also diagnostic, such as, the presence of a process on the internal face of the dentary, the first proximal anal-fin pterygiophore expanded and backward recurved (except in I. geisleri), and the anterior portion of the posterior chamber of the swimbladder thinner than its posterior portion. The genus Piabucus distinguishes from Iguanodectes by the presence of a long pectoral fin, and a well-developed pectoral keel. The subfamily is distributed in the Amazon (including its main tributaries), Orinoco, Paraguay, and Tocantins river basins, as well as the costal drainages from the Golfo de Pária (Venezuela) to immediately south of the mouth of the Amazon river (including rio Capim basin). The group is relatively well studied taxonomically (Böhlke,1954; Géry, 1970 and 1993; Vari, 1977), although some species remain to be described. Despite of some characters proposed as supporting the monophyly of the Iguanodectinae (Vari, 1977), the phylogenetic relationships of the Iguanodectinae with other groups of the Characiformes are still very tentative (Lucena, 1993), and none is known about the phylogenetic relationships between its species. Iguanodectes species are probably primarily herbivorous, feeding occasionally on allocthonous insects (Knöppel, 1970; Goulding et al. 1988; pers. obs.). Besides that, little information is known from their ecology. Some of its species are used as ornamental fishes.\r\n\r\nNote that Characidiinae, and \u003ci\u003eCrenuchus\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePoecilocharax\u003c/i\u003e are gathered in Crenuchidae, the two latter as the subfamily Crenuchinae since Buckup (1998: Ref. 040622) and in Buckup (2003: Ref. 37059).

Only one species occurs in true marine waters \u003ci\u003eTilapia guineensis\u003c/i\u003e (Günther, 1862).  Some species widely introduced. Body shape quite variable, mostly moderately deep and compressed. A nostril on each side of head. Interrupted lateral line in most species. Scales in lateral lines may be over 100, usually 20-50.

Parental care in 3 forms: mouthbrooding, substratebrooding, and substratebrooding of eggs then mouthbrooding of young. Species flocks are reported from Africa.\r\n\r\nCLOFFSCA:\r\n\r\nThe cichlids are the most species-rich non-Ostariophysan fish family in freshwaters world-wide, and one of the major vertebrate families, with at least 1300 species and with estimates approaching 1900 species (Kullander, 1998). \r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution includes freshwaters of Africa (900 valid species, estimated more than 1300 species), the Jordan Valley in the Middle East (four species), Iran (one species), southern India and Sri Lanka (3 species, also in brackish water), Madagascar (17 valid species, some also in brackish water), Cuba and Hispaniola (4 valid species, some in brackish water), North America and isthmian Central America (95 valid species), and South America (290 valid species ) (Kullander, 1998, updated).\r\n\r\nCichlids are known by family or genus-level local names, commonly with an adjective to distinguish well-marked species. Higher level names include bujurqui (Peru, most cichlids), acará (Brazil, most cichlids), mochoroca (Venezuela), mojarra (Ecuador, Colombia, throughout Central America), krobia (Surinam), prapra (French Guiana).\r\n \r\n\u003ci\u003eCichla\u003c/i\u003e species are known locally as pavón (Venezuela, Colombia) or tucunaré (Brazil, Peru), the latter name expressed as lukanani (Guyana), toekoenali (Surinam), toukounaré (French Guiana) or similar names in the Guianas. \u003ci\u003eCrenicichla\u003c/i\u003e  species are known as jacundá in Brazil, añashúa in Peru, angoumot (French Guiana), mataguaro (Colombia, Venezuela), datra fisi (Surinam), cabeza amarga (Argentina and Uruguay).\r\n\r\nCichlids are recognized by several unambiguous anatomical synapomorphies.\r\n1.\tThe loss of a major structural association between parts A2 and Aw of the adductor mandibulae muscle and the musculous insertion of a large ventral section of A2 onto the posterior border of the ascending process of the anguloarticular (Stiassny, 1981); \r\n2.\tThe presence of an extensive cartilaginous cap on the anterior margin of each second epibranchial bone (Stiassny, 1981);\r\n3.\tThe presence of an expanded head of each fourth epibranchial bone (Stiassny, 1981);\r\n4.\tThe presence of characteristically shaped and distributed micro-branchiospines on the gill arches (Stiassny, 1981);\r\n5.\tThe transversus dorsalis anterior muscle is subdivided into four distinct parts (Liem \u0026 Greenwood).\r\n6.\tThe stomach has an extendible blind pouch (Zihler, 1982)\r\n7.\tThe stomach has a left hand exit to the anterior intestine and the first intestinal loop is on the left side (Zihler, 1982)\r\n8.\tThe sagitta features an anterocaudal pseudocolliculum having a long and thick ventral part which is separated from the crista inferior by a long, deep and sharp furrow (Gaemers, 1985).\r\n9.\tShort paired hypapophyses on the third and/or fourth vertebral centra (Kullander, 1998).\r\n\r\nCichlid diversity has been explained both by their advanced brood care and by the versatile design of the pharyngeal jaw complex used for food mastication. The unpaired lower pharyngeal toothplate and the opposed upper pharyngeal tooth plates are contained in a muscular sling characterizing labroid fishes. There is considerable variation in the shape and of the toothplates and associated dentition, reflecting diet specializations. The oral jaws are generally highly movable and protrusible, and tooth shape varies greatly, although most Neotropical cichlids have simple, subconical, unicuspid teeth, whereas African cichlids commonly have laterally bicuspid or tricuspid oral teeth.\r\n\r\nAmong Neotropical fishes they can be recognized externally by the possession of 7-24 (usually 13-16) spines in the dorsal fin, 2-12 (usually 3, rarely more than 5) anal-fin spines; and a single nostril on each side of the head. The lateral line is usually divided into one anterior upper portion ending below the end of the dorsal-fin base, and a posterior lower portion running along the middle of the caudal peduncle. \r\n\r\nAmong Neotropical taxa, lengths range from about 25-30 mm adult size in \u003ci\u003eApistogramma\u003c/i\u003e  and \u003ci\u003eTaeniacara\u003c/i\u003e, to about 1 meter in \u003ci\u003eCichla temensis\u003c/i\u003e. Most taxa are in the interval 10-20 cm, however. \r\n\r\nMost Neotropical cichlids occupy lentic habitats within rivers and streams; but there is also a number of moderately to strongly adapted rheophilic species. The latter include many \u003ci\u003eCrenicichla\u003c/i\u003e  species and the genera \u003ci\u003eTeleocichla\u003c/i\u003e  and \u003ci\u003eRetroculus\u003c/i\u003e, which are distributed mainly in the Brazilian and Guianan highlands. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the Neotropical cichlids feed on a variety of invertebrates and some plant matter, and specializations among those species remain little investigated. \u003ci\u003eCichla\u003c/i\u003e, large \u003ci\u003eCrenicichla\u003c/i\u003e  species, \u003ci\u003ePetenia\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eParachromis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eCaquetaia\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eAstronotus\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eAcaronia\u003c/i\u003e, feed on fishes and large invertebrates. \u003ci\u003eChaetobranchopsis\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eChaetobranchus\u003c/i\u003e  and \u003ci\u003eSatanoperca acuticeps\u003c/i\u003e  are plankton feeders.\r\n\r\nMost Neotropical Cichlidae are moderately to strongly sex dimorphic, and breed pairwise. Eggs are typically deposited on a substrate and both parents guard offspring over several weeks, even for some time after the young are free-swimming. Smaller species, particularly in the genus \u003ci\u003eApistogramma\u003c/i\u003e, may be strongly sexually dimorphic. Sexes differ in color and the female is smaller than the male and assumes all or most of the care for the eggs and young. Oral incubation, or mouthbrooding, has been recorded for many \u003ci\u003eGeophagus\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eGymnogeophagus\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eSatanoperca\u003c/i\u003e  species, but also for one species of \u003ci\u003eAequidens\u003c/i\u003e  and one species of \u003ci\u003eHeros\u003c/i\u003e. Mouthbrooding species are usually biparental, and eggs are guarded on a substrate prior to oral incubation which starts with advanced eggs or newly hatched larvae. A few mouthbrooding species practice exclusive maternal brood care, with a minimum delay between egg-laying and oral incubation (\u003ci\u003eGymnogeophagus balzanii\u003c/i\u003e, NE Colombian \u003ci\u003eGeophagus\u003c/i\u003e  species).\r\n\r\nGeographical ranges are commonly limited to a single river or even one or a few streams, reflecting both ecological constraints and drainage basin histories. A few Neotropical cichlids are recorded from brackish water conditions. The northernmost species are \u003ci\u003eHerichthys\u003c/i\u003e  cyanoguttatus from the lower Rio Grande drainage in Texas, USA, on the Atlantic coast, and ‘\u003ci\u003eCichlasoma beani\u003c/i\u003e’, which reaches north to the Río Yaquí on the Pacific coast of Mexico. In South America cichlids are recorded from virtually all river drainages, but rarely occupy elevations over 500 m ASL, and generally remain below 200 m ASL. Cichlids are absent from the Río Marañón above the Pongo de Manseriche and from the Río Ucayali drainage upstream of Atalaya (the mouth of the Río Urubamba [Río Vilcanota] and Río Tombo [Río Apurimac]). There are four permanent cichlid species occurring on the island of Trinidad, but no cichlids are found on any other islands close to the Venezuelan coast. Most Atlantic coastal rivers of Brazil have 1-3 species of cichlids. The southern limit of the family in South America is not well documented, but may be in the lower Río Negro in Argentina, which river marks the northern limit of Patagonia.  \r\n\r\nOn the Pacific slope, cichlids are found in a succession of permanent rivers south to the Río Jequetepeque or perhaps even to slightly south of Lima, Peru. \r\n\r\nBecause of the varied behavior and often attractive colors and moderate size, cichlids are commonly kept as ornamental fish. Practically all genera and more than half of the species have been kept in aquaria at some time. The traditionally most important aquarium species are \u003ci\u003ePterophyllum\u003c/i\u003e  and \u003ci\u003eSymphysodon\u003c/i\u003e  species, the former often representing the aquarium hobby in logotypes.\r\n\r\nSportfishing is concentrated on the \u003ci\u003eCichla\u003c/i\u003e  species for which there is a strong North American and Brazilian market including sport fishing safaris and Tucunaré fishing contests predominantly in Brazil (Kelber, 1999).\r\n\r\nAll the larger species are used as food fish, within a traditional artisanal and subsistence fishery, and all local markets in the lowland Amazon and Orinoco drainages offer \u003ci\u003eCichla\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eAstronotus\u003c/i\u003e, and other available species of sizes over 10 cm (Ferreira et al., 1998, for a market survey at Santarém). \u003ci\u003eAstronotus\u003c/i\u003e  species, and to some extent \u003ci\u003eCichla\u003c/i\u003e  species are subject to aquaculture in Brazil. \r\n\r\nThe family Cichlidae was first monographed by Heckel (1840), based on the Natterer collection from Brazil (illustrations in Riedl-Dorn, 2000). Another early major treatise is by Jardine (1843), based on the Schomburgk collection from Guyana, Brazil and Venezuela (Kullander \u0026 Stawikowski, 1997a-b, for identifications). Steindachner (1875) worked on the Thayer expedition collection of Amazonian cichlids, but did not add much beyond the work of Heckel. Günther (1868, based on several shorter papers) described and illustrated a large part of the Central American cichlid fauna, followed by Regan (1906-1908).\r\n\r\nPellegrin (1904) revised the family with diagnoses of all genera and species known to him. Much of Pellegrin’s efforts with the Neotropical taxa were improved upon by Regan’s series of generic revisions in the next two years (Regan, 1905-1906), which remained the platform for all Neotropical cichlid systematics until the 1980s. The first modern phylogenetic revision of the Neotropical cichlids was presented by Cichocki (1976), and most recently Kullander (1988) and Farias et al. (1999) have provided phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphology and molecular data respectively. A formal classification down to tribe is provided by Kullander (1988).\r\n \r\nScientific general reviews of the family are provided by Keenleyside (1991) and Barlow (2000). There is no scientific monograph covering all Neotropical cichlid species, but numerous aquarium books of variable quality, of which Stawikowski \u0026 Werner (1998) may be consulted for the most updated compilation of cichlasomine cichlids. \r\n\r\nCountry monographs of cichlids are available for Peru (Kullander, 1986) and Surinam (Kullander \u0026 Nijssen, 1989). Bussing (1998: 293-384) summarizes data on 24 Costa Rican cichlid species; Keith et al. (2000: 146-229) summarize data for 38 cichlid species from French Guiana and adjacent countries; Greenfield \u0026 Thomerson (1997:184-206) cover 19 species from Belize\r\n\r\nRecent generic revisions cover \u003ci\u003eCrenicichla\u003c/i\u003e  (Ploeg, 1991; innumerable errors and inconsistencies), \u003ci\u003eGymnogeophagus\u003c/i\u003e  (Reis \u0026 Malabarba, 1988), \u003ci\u003eApistogramma\u003c/i\u003e  (Kullander, 1980, somewhat outdated), \u003ci\u003eCichlasoma\u003c/i\u003e  (Kullander, 1983), \u003ci\u003eTeleocichla\u003c/i\u003e  (Kullander, 1988), \u003ci\u003eRetroculus\u003c/i\u003e  (Gosse, 1971), \u003ci\u003eGeophagus\u003c/i\u003e  s. lato (Gosse, 1976, somewhat outdated), \u003ci\u003eBiotoecus\u003c/i\u003e  (Kullander, 1989), and \u003ci\u003eMesonauta\u003c/i\u003e  (Kullander \u0026 Silfvergrip, 1991).\r\n\r\nThe check-list herein recognizes 403 valid Neotropical cichlid species out of XXX nominal taxa. Kullander (1998) estimated that there are about ten undescribed North-Central American cichlid taxa and about 160 undescribed South American taxa. Numerous problems of species discrimination remain. Some of the most enigmatic cases includes ‘\u003ci\u003eCichlasoma’ urophthalmus\u003c/i\u003e, of which Hubbs (1936) described numerous subspecies. Some of these taxa are certainly distinct species, but the status of highly localized subspecies from the Yucatán peninsula, which are based on one or very few specimens, remains a subject for revision. All these taxa are herein treated as valid for want of any better option. \r\n\r\nAnother source of frustration concerns the generic assignment of Central American taxa, and a few South American taxa, which were excluded from the catch-all genus \u003ci\u003eCichlasoma\u003c/i\u003e  by Kullander (1983). Most of these are now recognized in well-diagnosed genera (Kullander, 1986, 1996, Kullander \u0026 Hartel, 1997), but several are kept with the generic denomination ‘\u003ci\u003eCichlasoma\u003c/i\u003e’ which is judged better than to include them in genera to which they certainly do not belong. \r\n\r\nOn the whole it is not satisfactory to have one-third of the Neotropical cichlid fauna without a generic name, illustrating a real problem with the more formalized procedure of naming species, but it could also signify a safeguarding against doubtful species. The current estimate of 450 South American taxa is based on species already represented in museum collections; it can be assumed that new collections will bring in many more new taxa."},{"FamCode":352,"Family":"Cirrhitidae","CommonName":"Hawkfishes","Genera":9,"Species":32,"FamPic":"CIRRHIT0","Remark":"Distribution: tropical western and eastern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific (mainly Indo-Pacific).

The Ctenoluciidae is also distinguished within the Characiformes by a series of derived features discussed by Vari (1995).  Members of the family range from moderate sized species (e.g., \u003ci\u003eCtenolucius hujeta\u003c/i\u003e; largest examined specimen 22.8 cm SL) to among the largest of New World characiforms (\u003ci\u003eBoulengerella cuvieri\u003c/i\u003e; largest examined specimen 67.5 cm SL).  The taxonomy, morphology, phylogenetics, and biogeography of the family were discussed by Vari (1995). \r\n\r\nCtenoluciids are distributed though the lowlands and lower elevation uplands to both sides of the Andean Cordilleras.  \u003ci\u003eCtenolucius\u003c/i\u003e ranges from the Pacific Ocean slope rivers of western Panama, though the river systems of northwestern and northern Colombia, to the eastern tributaries of the Lago Maracaibo basin in northwestern Venezuela.  \u003ci\u003eBoulengerella\u003c/i\u003e is widely distributed in the Río Orinoco, Rio Amazonas, and Rio Tocantins basins and the shorter coastal rivers of Guyana, French Guiana (Guyane), and the Brazilian states of Amapá and Pará.\r\n\r\nAccording to Breder (1925:144), Miles (1941:65) and Dahl (1971:106) \u003ci\u003eCtenolucius\u003c/i\u003e species are predators in calm waters with immature specimens gathering together in schools and adults being solitary hunters.  \u003ci\u003eBoulengerella\u003c/i\u003e species are all predators, apparently feeding exclusively on fishes as adults (Goulding et al., 1988: 135, 139, 140, 144, 173).  Breeding behavior of \u003ci\u003eB. cuvieri\u003c/i\u003e was discussed by Mendes dos Santos et al.

Large sac-like muscular epibranchial organ that extends dorsal to the medial elements of the dorsal portions of the gill arches; reduction or loss of dentition on the fifth upper pharyngeal tooth plate and loss on the ceratobranchial. Generally detritivorous. Maximum length 45 cm.  Suggested new common name for this family from Ref. 58418.\r\nCLOFFSCA\r\n\r\nDistinguished from all other Characiformes by the combination of the total absence in adults of dentition in either jaw (a feature present elsewhere among characiforms only in \u003ci\u003eAnodus\u003c/i\u003e of the family Hemiodontidae) and a series of internal synapomorphies in multiple body systems (see Vari (1989: 52) for a summary).  The species of the Curimatidae are broadly distributed across southern Central America and much of tropical and subtemperate South America.  Members of the family occur in the Trans-Andean Pacific Ocean drainages from southwestern Costa Rica (Bussing, 1988: 127) to northwestern Peru (Vari, 1989: 17).  Curimatids inhabit the Trans-Andean Carribean versant drainages from the Atrato River of northwestern Colombia (Vari, 1991:38) to the western drainages of the Lago Maracaibo basin in northwestern Venezuela (Vari, 1984: 25).  East of the Andean Cordilleras, curimatids occupy most river basins from the Río Orinoco system to slightly south of Buenos Aires, Argentina, being most speciose in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, with less diverse assemblages of species inhabiting the coastal rivers of the Guianas, the rio Sno Francisco basin, and various of the shorter rivers from northeastern Brazil to Uruguay (Vari, 1989).  \r\n\r\nExternally the fishes of this family range from fusiform to deep bodied, slab-sided fishes (Vari, 1989: figs. 1-2), but with most species of intermediate body form.  Internally these fishes demonstrate numerous modifications of various body systems, most notably the gill arches (Vari, 1989).  Members of the family demonstrate a nearly ten fold range in standard lengths, with the largest know adult males of \u003ci\u003eCurimatopsis evelynae\u003c/i\u003e achieving approximately 3.3 cm SL (Vari, 1982:26) and the largest reported specimens of \u003ci\u003eCurimata mivartii\u003c/i\u003e being over 32.0 cm SL (Dahl, 1971: 105).\r\n\r\nMany species travel in large schools (Mendez dos Santos, 1984: 28-29) that often constitute a major portion of the fish biomass in both riverine and lacustrine habitats.  They have a number of modifications of the mouth, gill-arches, and digestive tract which allow them to efficiently utilize the flocculent organic mater, microdetritus, microvegetation, and filamentous algae that are common in those habitats across the Neotropics (Carvalho, 1984: Nomura and Hayashi, 1980; Nomura and Taveira, 1979).  Some members of the family are known to engage in mass spawning migrations (Godoy, 1975: 581).  \r\n\r\nThe questions of the relationships of the Curimatidae to other characiforms and of the generic-level intrarelationships within the family were dealt with by Vari (1983, 1989).  The species level taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography of the Curimatidae has been examined in a series of revisionary studies (\u003ci\u003eCurimata\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1989; Vari and Reis, 1995); \u003ci\u003eCurimatella\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1992); \u003ci\u003eCurimatopsis\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1982, 1982); \u003ci\u003eCyphocharax\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1992; Vari and Blackledge, 1996) \u003ci\u003ePotamorhina\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1984); \u003ci\u003ePsectrogaster\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1989); \u003ci\u003ePseudocurimata\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1989); and \u003ci\u003eSteindachnerina\u003c/i\u003e (Vari, 1991, 1993; Vari and Williams Vari, 1989).   These publications placed a  number of species into synonymy, but also resulted in the description of numerous species new to science.  Several as of yet undescribed species are known to researchers and it is expected that additional species await discovery.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their annual mass migrations various species of this family are exploited in commercial and subsistence fisheries from Colombia (Dahl, 1971: 105) through Venezuela (Mago-Leccia, 1970: 31) into the Amazon (Goulding, 1981:60) and elsewhere in South America (Lowe-McConnell, 1975).

The Cynodontinae is represented by the largest members of the family with some of its species reaching up to 65 cm in length and possessing maximum development of dentary canines among cynodontids. The subfamily has been the subject of recent taxonomic and phylogenetic investigation by Toledo-Piza, (2000) and Toledo-Piza et al.  (1999) with three genera being recognized: \u003ci\u003eCynodon\u003c/i\u003e\r\n with 3 species, hypothesized as the sister group to  the monotypic \u003ci\u003eRhaphiodon\u003c/i\u003e, and this clade being the sister group to \u003ci\u003eHydrolycus\u003c/i\u003e with 4 species. The Roestinae includes species that reach a maximum length of 20 cm and are represented by \u003ci\u003eRoestes\u003c/i\u003e with 3 species and \u003ci\u003eGilbertolus\u003c/i\u003e with two (Menezes \u0026 Lucena, 1998). \r\n\r\nThe majority of cynodontid species occur in the Rio Amazonas and Río Orinoco basins, and in the rivers of the Atlantic slopes of the Guianas. \u003ci\u003eRhaphiodon vulpinus\u003c/i\u003e is the only Cynodontidae that ranges southward to the Paraná-Paraguay and Uruguay basins, and \u003ci\u003eGilbertolus\u003c/i\u003e occurs in the transandean drainages of the Río Atrato, Río Magdalena, and Lago Maracaibo basins of Colombia and Venezuela. Fossil cynodontids are represented by dentary canines originated in Miocene deposits from the La Venta fauna, located in the present Río Magdalena valley of Western Colombia, in the Anta Formation at Quebrada de la Yesera, Salta, and near the city of Paraná, Entre Ríos the latter two localities in Argentina (Lundberg, 1997; Cione \u0026 Casciotta, 1995, 1997).\r\n\r\nMost of what is known about the habits and biology of the Cynodontidae refers to members of the Cynodontinae. They live in mid- and surface waters of rivers, lakes, and flooded forests in all water types, are predatory fishes, mainly piscivorous, using their dentary canines to stab prey (Arendt 1997; Goulding, 1980). Although not much valued as food, some species may have some importance in subsistence commercial fisheries (Mendes dos Santos et al., 1984; and Taphorn, 1992). \u003ci\u003eHydrolycus\u003c/i\u003e is a sport species having been recently added to the International Game Fish Association in the fly and rod class (International Game Fish Association, 1995).

There are seven genera (\u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eBrachygalaxias\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eGalaxias\u003c/i\u003e [including \u003ci\u003eNesogalaxias\u003c/i\u003e from New Caledonia], \u003ci\u003eGalaxiella\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eLovettia\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eNeochanna\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eParagalaxias\u003c/i\u003e)  and about 51 species.  Five new species of \u003ci\u003eGalaxias\u003c/i\u003e were described in the last few years when it was discovered that \u003ci\u003eG. vulgaris\u003c/i\u003e from the South Island of New Zealand was actually a species complex (Wallis et al., 2000).\r\n\r\nGalaxiids are elongate, scaleless fishes and all lack an adipose fin except \u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eLovettia\u003c/i\u003e.  Some species are rather stocky and tubular.  Most species have seven pelvic and 16 caudal fin rays (McDowall, 1990), however there is wide variation of other elements of the caudal skeleton within and among species (McDowall, 1999).  A lateral line is present. Some species may have an accessory lateral line composed of small, widely spaced neuromasts along the dorsolateral trunk from the occiput to the dorsal fin (McDowall, 1997).  This accessory lateral line may function in sensing food or predators at the water's surface. The dorsal fin is situated posteriorly and more or less above the anal fin.\r\n\r\nNelson (1994) listed three subfamilies of the Galaxiidae: Lovettiinae, Aplochitoninae, and Galaxiinae.  The Lovettiinae is found only in Tasmania. The subfamily Aplochitoninae (previously considered a separate family)  is composed of two species of \u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e from southern South America (McDowall 1971a).\r\n\r\nThe dorsal fin of \u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e is anteriorly positioned over the pelvic fins.  An adipose fin is present, and the caudal fin is forked.  \u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e is probably amphidromous with the larvae being carried to sea after hatching in freshwater streams.  McDowall (1984b) reported a post-larval \u003ci\u003eAplochiton\u003c/i\u003e taken at sea in southern Chile.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxiinae includes five genera and about 48 species.  This subfamily is most diverse in Australia, especially Tasmania, and in New Zealand.  However, representatives also occur in South America, and one species inhabits Cape coastal streams at the southern tip of South Africa (Berra, 2001).   No members of the family or subfamily occur in the Northern Hemisphere in spite of Day's description of \u003ci\u003eG. indicus\u003c/i\u003e, which McDowall (1973b) regarded as a nomen dubium.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003eGalaxias maculatus\u003c/i\u003e has one of the most widely disjunct distributions of any freshwater fish (Berra et al., 1996).   \u003ci\u003eGalaxias maculatus\u003c/i\u003e occurs in eastern and western Australia, Tasmania, Lord Howe Island, New Zealand, Chatham Island, southern Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands/Malvinas (McDowall, 1970, Berra 2001).  Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain this disjunct distribution: dispersal (movement through the sea) and vicariance (continental drift).  \r\n\r\nA summary of this debate involving McDowall (1970), Rosen (1974, 1978) and others is given by Berra et al. (1996) who used allozyme electrophoresis of muscle extracts of \u003ci\u003eG. maculatus\u003c/i\u003e from eastern and western Australia, New Zealand, and Chile to test the hypothesis that populations from the western Pacific and the eastern Pacific do not differ genetically.  They found only minor differentiation in allele frequency at some loci and no fixation of alternative alleles.  The populations appeared to be part of the same gene pool indicating that gene flow via dispersal through the sea occurs today.  Only a small amount of gene flow is necessary to prevent accumulation of genetic differences by random drift.  The marine larval stage of \u003ci\u003eG. maculatus\u003c/i\u003e has a six-month period to traverse the distance between the southern continents (McDowall et al., 1994) and could provide enough gene flow to deter fixation for alternative alleles. A study of mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence by Waters and Burridge (1999) also supported the dispersal argument, but reported greater population differentiation than detected by Berra et al. (1996) with allozymes.\r\n\r\nOther South American galaxiids include two additional species of \u003ci\u003eGalaxias\u003c/i\u003e and the small, colorful \u003ci\u003eBrachygalaxias bullocki\u003c/i\u003e (McDowall, 1971b).  \u003ci\u003eGalaxias platei\u003c/i\u003e occurs in Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands/Malvinas, and the very rare, if not extinct, \u003ci\u003eG. globiceps\u003c/i\u003e is known from only a few specimens taken near Puerto Montt, Chile (Berra and Ruiz, 1994, Berra and Barbour, 1998).  \u003ci\u003eBrachygalaxias bullocki\u003c/i\u003e resembles \u003ci\u003eGalaxiella\u003c/i\u003e of Australia, but whether this similarity is due to convergence or phylogeny is not clear. Waters (1996), Waters and Cambray (1997), and Waters et al. (2000) provided mtDNA data useful for phylogenetic analysis of galaxiids."},{"FamCode":109,"Family":"Gasteropelecidae","CommonName":"Freshwater hatchetfishes","Genera":3,"Species":9,"FamPic":"GASTERT0","Remark":"Fishes of the family Gasteropelecidae have the following characteristics: Frontal bone longitudinally corrugated, bearing a strong longitudinal ridge.

The lower jaw much longer than upper jaw; premaxillae pointed anteriorly;  short pectoral and pelvic fins. Vertebrae 38-75 (except 18-25 in \u003ci\u003eArrhamphus\u003c/i\u003e).

Surface dwelling omnivores of algae, zooplankton and fishes.\r\n\r\nCLOFFSCA:\r\nThe Hemiramphidae, the halfbeaks, are one of five families of the order Beloniformes. They are the sister-group of the Exocoetidae, the flying fishes, forming the superfamily Exocoetoidea (Collette et al., 1984). Most halfbeaks have an elongate lower jaw that distinguishes them from flying fishes which have lost the elongate lower jaw and from needlefishes (Belonidae) and sauries (Scomberesocidae) which have both jaws elongate. The family is defined by one derived character, third pair of upper pharyngeal bones anklylosed into a plate. Other diagnostic characters include: pectoral fins short or moderately long; premaxillae pointed anteriorly, forming a triangular upper jaw (except in Oxyporhamphus); lower jaw elongate in juveniles of all genera, adults of most genera; parapophyses forked; swimbladder not extending into haemal canal; nostrils in a pit anterior to the eyes; no spines in fins; dorsal and anal fins posterior in position; pelvic fins in abdominal position, with 6 soft rays; lateral line running down from pectoral fin origin and then backward along ventral margin of body. Scales moderately large, cycloid, easily detached. Color. These fishes live at the surface and are protectively colored for this mode of life being green or blue on the back and silvery white on the sides and ventrally. Tip of the lower jaw bright red or orange in life in most species.\r\n\r\nMost species are marine, but some inhabit freshwaters; omnivorous, feeding on floating sea grasses, crustaceans and small fishes. They are prone to leap and skitter at the surface and one offshore species, Euleptorhamphus velox can leap out of the water and glide like a flying fish. The flesh is excellent and larger species of halfbeaks are utilized as food in many parts of the world. In the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, they are more important as baitfish for billfishes, dolphins, kingfish, wahoo, and king mackerel than as food fish. They are caught with seines or dipnetted under lights at night.\r\n\r\nThe Hemiramphidae contains 12 genera and over 100 species (Collette, in press.) Four genera, the first three monotypic (Arrhamphus, Chriodorus, Melapedalion, and Oxyporhampus) have very short or no beaks. Euleptorhamphus and Oxyporhamphus contain two offshore species each. The subfamily Zenarchopterinae, which is now recognized as a separate family, Zenarchopteridae (Ref. ), contains five genera and about 50 sexually dimorphic internally-fertilizing Indo-West Pacific estuarine or freshwater species (Meisner and Collette, 1999). Three of these genera (Dermogenys, Hemirhamphodon, and Nomorhamphus) are viviparous and have the anal fin of the male modified into an andropodium. Hemiramphus (with 10 species) is a world wide marine genus. Rhynchorhamphus (with 4 species) has fimbriate nasal papillae and is confined to Indo-West Pacific marine waters. Hyporhamphus, the most speciose genus, includes two subgenera, Hyporhamphus with 23 species and Reporhamphus with 11 species, all confined to the Indo-West Pacific. Some species are marine, some estuarine, and some freshwater. All genera are characterized by particular lateral line characters (Parin and Astakhov, 1982). The halfbeak fauna of the western Atlantic includes nine marine species in five genera (Collette, in press), Chriodorus (1 species), Euleptorhamphus (1), Oxyporhamphus (1), Hemiramphus (3), and Hyporhamphus (3), plus two freshwater species of Hyporhamphus in rivers draining into the western Atlantic."},{"FamCode":492,"Family":"Hemiscylliidae","CommonName":"Bamboo sharks","Genera":2,"Species":11,"FamPic":"HEMISCT0","Remark":"Tropical western Pacific from Madagascar in the west to Japan, the Philippines and the Australian region in the East.

Hypopomid species possess the following unique combination of characters among gymnotiforms: teeth absent from both jaws; snout moderate to short length (preorbital region less than 38% head length); eye small (diameter less than distance between nares); nasal capsule near eye, anterior nares located outside gape; infraorbital bones ossified as slender tubes; operculum trapezoidal; hyomandibula oriented oblique to long axis of head; anal-fin origin ventral or posterior to pectoral fin-base; no urogenital papilla; no caudal fin or dorsal organ. Hypopomids also possess a multiphasic (usually biphasic) electric organ discharge produced as discrete pulses. \r\n\r\nThere are currently 23 names available in the literature for hypopomid genera and species. Of these, 6 generic and 25 species names are valid.  There are in addition 10 manuscript names for species currently in preparation, bringing the known diversity of Hypopomidae to 35 species. Many more hypopomid species are anticipated, as the rate of description is accelerating. \r\n\r\nHypopomids are relatively conservative in terms of overall external morphology. Like all gymnotiforms the shape is typically culteriform, with an elongate body and anal fin. \r\n\r\nHigher level hypopomid taxonomy emphasizes differences in: snout length and body profile, ranging from highly compressed laterally (e.g., \u003ci\u003eSteatogenys\u003c/i\u003e) to cylindrical and worm-like (e.g., \u003ci\u003eMicrosternarchus\u003c/i\u003e). Hypopomids are small to medium sized electric fishes, ranging in total adult body size, from the smallest extant gymnotiform species \u003ci\u003eHypopygus lepturus\u003c/i\u003e (80 mm) to \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus brevirostris\u003c/i\u003e (350 mm). \r\n\r\nThe Hypopomidae is confined to the Humid Neotropics, ranging the Rio de la Plata of Argentina (35° S) to the Rio Tuira of Panama (8°N). Hypopomids are known from the continental waters of all South American countries except Chile (Albert, 2001), and are most diverse  - both taxonomically and ecologically - in the Amazon basin. \r\n\r\nThe ecology and natural history of most hypopomid species is very poorly understood. \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus\u003c/i\u003e is perhaps the most well studied group; it is also the most widely distributed hypopomid genus, in terms of both geography and habitat, extending the full range of the family. \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus\u003c/i\u003e species inhabit seasonal streams in the relative to highly desertified areas of northwest Venezuela (Falcón), Gran Sabana (central Guyana), northeast Brazil, southeast Brazil, and northern Argentina (Chaco) (Costa and Campos-da-Paz, 1992). \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus\u003c/i\u003e is also highly diverse and abundant in floating meadows of Central Amazonia. \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus\u003c/i\u003e is able to tolerate protracted periods of hypoxic water conditions, at least in part because they can hold air bubbles in the gill chamber for use in aerial respiration. \r\n\r\nHypopomid systematics and taxonomy is rapidly changing as new species and previously undocumented phenotypes are discovered. The total expected number of species cannot currently be estimated with confidence.  A large number of undescribed hypopomid species are known in museum collections and many more are likely to be captured from continued field studies, particularly in Western and Central Amazonia.  \r\n\r\nThere is little direct commercial exploitation of hypopomid species. \u003ci\u003eBrachyhypopomus\u003c/i\u003e species are ecologically important in floating meadows of white water floodplains, often constituting a significant fraction of the biomass (Crampton, 1996). \u003ci\u003eSteatogenys elegans\u003c/i\u003e is an important part of the biomass in the main channels of Amazonian channels.

The family has an extensive taxonomic history dating back to 1834, but was known long before formal taxonomic recognition (Castex, 1963a). Potamotrygonids are much maligned and feared because of their venomous caudal stings, but pose little or no threat if not stepped on or directly interfered with. The Potamotrygonidae is the only living chondrichthyan family restricted to freshwater habitats.\r\n\r\nPotamotrygonid stingrays are clearly monophyletic, sharing unique morphological and physiological specializations, including a pelvis with a greatly expanded anterior median process (pre-pelvic process), blood with low concentrations of urea, and reduction of the rectal gland (Garman, 1877; Thorson et al., 1983a). They are generally medium to large sized batoids, ranging from about 25 cm in disc width or length to more than 100 cm in adults of some species. Species of \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e have moderately stout and short tails, usually shorter than disc length, whereas \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e have slender, filiform and whiplike tails (in \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e the tail is very long in juveniles but absolutely reduced in adults, and in \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e it is much longer than disc length but also stout at base). The dorsal surface of the disc and tail are usually covered with many denticles, thorns and tubercles. The caudal sting (or serrated spine) is a rigid dermal derivative, located on the dorsal surface of the tail, containing small lateral serrations directed toward its base and an acute distal tip. The sting is reduced and situated closer to the tail base in \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e, but well developed and located farther posteriorly in both \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e. The stings contain longitudinal grooves to conduct venom produced in special glands at their bases, and are continuously worn, shed and replaced; up to four stings may be present in one individual. Additionally, many species have enlarged, non-venomous spines on disc margins or over tail, sometimes in numerous rows. The disc is usually slightly longer than wide (especially in \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e), and covers most of the pelvic fins posteriorly (but less in \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e). Dorsal and caudal fins are absent, but membranous skin folds (finfolds), with rudimentary internal radial elements, occur in \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e on both upper and lower tail midlines posterior to caudal stings (only ventral finfold is present in \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e, and finfolds are absent in \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e). The eyes are moderately large in \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e, but smaller and less protruded in \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e. Oral teeth are small with short cusps (more prominent in adult males), in usually less than 50 rows in either jaw (large specimens of \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e may have more than 60 rows), and set in quincunx. Most potamotrygonid species have colorful dorsal arrangements, including spots of various dimensions, ocelli, reticulate patterns, and vermiform markings, which are generally species-specific, and grey, brown or black background coloration. \r\n\r\nPotamotrygonids are ovoviviparous (aplacentally viviparous), and the developing embryos are nourished by uterine milk secreted by trophonemata (Thorson et al., 1983b). Both uteri are functional and appear to be synchronous. Gestation may be restricted to certain stations or occur throughout the year, and the number of young produced in each gestation varies among species, but is usually from two to seven. \r\n\r\nPotamotrygonids only occur in South American rivers that drain into the Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean Sea. They are are conspicuously absent, however, from the São Francisco basin in northeastern Brazil, rivers that drain into the Atlantic from the Atlantic rainforest of northeastern and southeastern Brazil, the upper Paraná basin, and rivers south of the La Plata river in Argentina. Generally, most potamotrygonid species have distributions restricted to a single basin or river system, with only a few species present in more than one basin (e.g. \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon motoro\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon orbignyi\u003c/i\u003e). Some species are even restricted to a single river (e.g. \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon leopoldi\u003c/i\u003e). This high endemism has led recent workers to express concern that some species may be endangered (Compagno \u0026 Cook, 1995; Rosa \u0026 Menezes, 1996), or are at least clearly vulnerable at present (two species are cited on the IUCN Red List as \"data deficient\"). Potamotrygonids are generally not consumed as food, but are commercialized in increasing quantity by the aquarium trade, and are only seldomly bred in captivity for commercial purposes. Further studies on their population structure and dynamics are therefore very much needed. \r\n\r\nThe literature concerning potamotrygonids is vast. After the revision of Garman (1913), the next taxonomic study to treat the entire family is that of Rosa (1985a). Anatomical descriptions can be found in Garman (1877, 1913), Thorson \u0026 Watson (1975), Rosa (1985a), Nishida (1990), Taniuchi \u0026 Ishihara (1990), and Lovejoy (1996). Their phylogenetic relationships have been treated by Rosa (1985a), Dingerkus (1995), Lovejoy (1996) and McEachran et al. (1996). Accounts of their natural history are presented by Castex (1964a) and Castello (1975). Physiological aspects of potamotrygonids are summarized in Thorson et al. (1983a), and the reproductive biology of certain species by Thorson et al. (1983b), Teshima \u0026 Takeshita (1992), and Lasso et al. (1997a). Their historical biogeography has been studied by Brooks et al. (1981), Lovejoy (1996, 1997), Lovejoy et al. (1998), and Lundberg (1998). Recent descriptions of fossil remains (mostly isolated denticles) can be found in Deynat \u0026 Brito (1996) and Lundberg (1997). Recent taxonomic and historic compilations are those by Compagno \u0026 Cook (1995) and Zorzi (1995), and the extensive literature on potamotrygonid parasites is summarized in Brooks \u0026 Amato (1992).\r\n\r\nThe following account is mostly based on original work by the first author, supplemented by information from Rosa (1985a) concerning type specimens of \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e deposited in museums in Argentina. This account differs from the revision of Rosa (1985a) in relation to the fate of various nominal species, and is also more conservative, recognizing fewer species. At least five new species have been found and are not included here (these are presently being described elsewhere). Taxonomic work on the family is constrained by the fact that many species of \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e are poorly described, lack adequate material, or present much intraspecific variation in coloration. This is compounded by generally overlapping meristic and morphometric features among species of \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e (both other genera are monotypic). Therefore, the approach adopted here has been to not recognize certain species that are inadequately defined at present, or that lack adequate material for proper characterization (e.g. \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon dumerilii\u003c/i\u003e,\u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon humerosa\u003c/i\u003e). The current account is a working summary of the family, one that is subject to modifications as more collecting and research is conducted. This family is treated as it has traditionally been used in the literature, i.e. restricting it to \u003ci\u003ePotamotrygon\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eParatrygon\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePlesiotrygon\u003c/i\u003e only, and refrain from including other genera that have recently been hypothesized as being their sister-taxa (amphi-American \u003ci\u003eHimantura\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eTaeniura\u003c/i\u003e; Lovejoy, 1996; McEachran et al. 1996). Note that DW is disc width, and DL is disc length, which are standard measurements in stingrays (total length is usually not used as the distal tip of the tail is frequently missing in specimens)."},{"FamCode":303,"Family":"Priacanthidae","CommonName":"Bigeyes or catalufas","Genera":4,"Species":18,"FamPic":"PRIACAT0","Remark":"Tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.

Upon protraction these lips form an oral disk encircled by teeth.  The two tooth rows in each jaw are variably separated from each other proximate  to the symphysis, but converge towards the lateral margins of each jaw.  The members of this family are moderate to large sized, robust fishes (reaching up to 74 cm TL in \u003ci\u003eProchilodus lineatus\u003c/i\u003e, Sverlij et al., 1993:36) with relatively large scales, fleshy to very fleshy lips (particularly in \u003ci\u003eIchthyoelephas\u003c/i\u003e), and pronounced stripes across the anal and caudal fins in \u003ci\u003eSemaprochilodus\u003c/i\u003e species, other than for very large individuals.  The dorsal fin is preceded by a procumbent spine which is either bifurcate (\u003ci\u003eProchilodus\u003ci\u003e and \u003ci\u003eSemaprochilodus\u003c/i\u003e) or pointed (\u003ci\u003eIchthyoelephas\u003c/i\u003e) anteriorly.  Although the three genera are readily distinguished externally, the external morphology of most species in each genus is relatively constant and many species can be difficult to tell apart.     \r\nThe species of this family are limited to South America and occur to the west of the Andes in the Lago Maracaibo basin of Colombia and Venezuela, the Carribean versant rivers of northwestern Colombia and the Pacific slope rivers of northwestern and southwestern Ecuador.  East of the \tAndes, prochilodontids occur in the Río Orinoco, Rio Amazon, Rio Tocantins, and Río de La Plata basins, the coastal rivers of the Guianas, the Rio São Francisco and the other coastal rivers of eastern Brazil, and the northern portions of the Lagoa dos Patos basin of southern Brazil. They inhabit a diversity of habitats ranging from still ox-bow lakes, through flowing major rivers, to moderately rapid streams in piedmont regions and occur in black, clear, and white water.      \r\nAll species of this family exploit detritus and  aufwucks (periphyton) on subaquatic surfaces (Araújo-Lima et al., 1986; Bowen, 1984; Bowen et al., 1984).  The prevalence of these resources both in permanent fresh waters (Flecker, 1996:1845) and the seasonally flooded rain forest (Goulding et al., 1988:61-62, fig. 6.1) most probably accounts for the prominence of these species in Neotropical freshwaters (e.g., lower Río Parana basin where \u003ci\u003eProchilodus lineatus\u003c/i\u003e accounts for over 60% of total ichthyomass; Bonetto, 1975, 1994).  As a consequence of their detritus feeding habits and large populations, these species play a significant role in energy flow within the aquatic systems which they inhabit (Jepsen et al., 1997:1085; Winemiller, 1996:303) and are functionally dominant in some aquatic ecosystems (Flecker, 1996:1850).   Species of the Prochilodontidae undertake dramatic mass migrations associated with feeding and reproduction (Goulding, 1981:100-104; Ribeiro and Petrere, 1990:200), with some individuals traveling minimally nearly 1500 km between their mark and recapture (Sverlij et al., 1993:28) with daily movements of up to 43 km (de Godoy, 1975:43).  These species are famous for their ability to overcome obstacles encountered during  migrations by strenuous swimming and dramatic leaps of several meters (Goulding, 1981:103; Patiño R, 1973:81).                                                                           \r\n\r\nThe species-level taxonomy of the Prochilodontidae has long been pervaded by uncertainty (Mago-Leccia, 1972:35) as a consequence of various factors intrinsic (overall similarity of different species) and extrinsic (e.g., uninformative original descriptions and loss of type series) to the species.  Mago-Leccia (1972) reviewed the prochilodontid species that occur in Venezuela.  Subsequently, Castro (1988, 1993) described two previously undescribed species.  The taxonomy of all species of the Prochilodontidae was evaluated in an unpublished thesis (Castro, 1990) and in a ongoing revisionary and phylogenetic analysis (Castro and Vari, in prep.).  The entries for the species in the following account are derived from the information in those two studies.  Based on our results we expect that future research is unlikely to reveal many additional undescribed species in the family.   \r\n\t                  \r\nMembers of the all genera of the Prochilodontidae are very important in both commercial and subsistence fishes across the range of the family.  In the lower Rio Negro of Brazil, over 90 percent of the commercial catch consists of two \u003ci\u003eSemaprochilodus\u003c/i\u003e species (Goulding et al., 1988:61) and prochilodontids are becoming progressively more important in the commercial fishes of the central portion of the Amazon basin (Ribeiro and Petrere, 1990:196).  Sverlij et al. (1993:51) report that \u003ci\u003eProchilodus lineatus\u003c/i\u003e constitutes 40% of the total fishery in the Río Paraná, 86% of the fishery in the Río de La Plata, and 95% of the fishery in the Río Uruguay.  Other prochilodontid species are similarly important in the commercial and subsistence fisheries of Colombia (Dahl, 1971:xvi, Sánchez, M. et al., 2000:218), Venezuela (Espinosa and Gimenez, 1974:1: Novoa R. et al., 1982:277), and other countries (Welcomme, 1979:200).  The importance of the Prochilodontidae in commercial and subsistence fisheries across the range of the family is also reflected in the numerous studies involving the induced spawning and captive rearing of members of the family (e.g., Antoniutti et al., 1995; Bustamente-Varón et al, 1997; and references therein).\r\n\r\nCommon name for this family encoded from Ref. 58010."},{"FamCode":569,"Family":"Profundulidae","CommonName":"Middle American killifishes","Genera":1,"Species":5,"FamPic":"PROFUNT0","Remark":"Distribution: Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Middle America in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Sternopygid species possess the following unique combination of characters among gymnotiforms: multiple rows of small, villiform (brush-like) teeth in both jaws; large eye (diameter equal to or greater than distance between nares); infraorbital bones large and bag-like, with expanded bony arches; anterior nares located outside gape; anal-fin origin at isthmus; no urogenital papilla, caudal fin or dorsal organ. Sternopygids possess a tone-type electric organ discharge, characterized by a monophasic hyperpolarization from negative baseline.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 40 names available in the literature for sternopygid genera and species. Of these, 6 generic and 30 species names are valid.  There are in addition 11 manuscript names for species currently in preparation, bringing the known diversity of Sternopygidae to 41 species. Many more sternopygid species are anticipated, as the rate of description is accelerating.\r\n \r\nSternopygid are relatively conservative in terms of overall external morphology. Like all gymnotiforms the shape is culteriform, with an elongate body and anal fin. \r\n\r\nHigher level sternopygid taxonomy emphasizes differences in orbital margin, extent of body compression, and osteological features. Many sternopygid species specialized for life in main river channels.  Many species are highly compressed laterally and translucent in life (e.g., some \u003ci\u003eEigenmannia\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eRhabdolichops\u003c/i\u003e). Sternopygids are medium to large-sized gymnotiforms, exhibiting substantial diversity in total adult body size, from 120 mm (\u003ci\u003eSternopygus vicentespelaea\u003c/i\u003e) to 1.4 M (\u003ci\u003eSternopygus macrurus\u003c/i\u003e). \r\n\r\nThe Sternopygidae is confined to the Humid Neotropics, ranging the Rio de la Plata of Argentina (35° S) to the Rio Tuira of Panama (8°N). Sternopygids are known from the continental waters of all South American countries except Chile (Albert, 2001), and are most diverse  - both taxonomically and ecologically - in the Amazon basin. \r\n\r\nThe ecology and natural history of most sternopygid species is very poorly understood. Sternopygus is the most widely distributed sternopygid genus, in terms of both geography and habitat, extending the full range of the family. \u003ci\u003eSternopygus\u003c/i\u003e species inhabit both floodplain and tierra firme (non-floodplain) streams and rivers.  Many sternopygids forage on small aquatic animals (e.g., dipteran larvae) from the benthos or roots of aquatic vegetation; \u003ci\u003eRhabdolichops\u003c/i\u003e species are planktivorous, consuming insect and crustacean larvae. \r\n\r\nSternopygid systematics and taxonomy is rapidly changing as new species and previously undocumented phenotypes are discovered. The total expected number of species cannot currently be estimated with confidence.  A large number of undescribed sternopygid species are known in museum collections and many more are likely to be captured from continued field studies, particularly in Western Amazonia.\r\n                                                                        \r\nThere is little direct commercial exploitation of sternopygid species. Some \u003ci\u003eEigenmannia\u003c/i\u003e species are ecologically important in many riverine systems, often constituting a large proportion of the biomass, and are presumed to form an important base of the food web in main Amazonian river channels (Lundberg et al., 1987).  Two species, \u003ci\u003eSternopygus macrurus\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eEigenmannia\u003c/i\u003e cf. \u003ci\u003evirescens\u003c/i\u003e are common in the aquarium trade.
